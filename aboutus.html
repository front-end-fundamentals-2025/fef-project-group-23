        “ aimée is a company founded by two passionate and innovative women who
        share a deep love for fashion. Recognising that our planet doesn’t need
        more clothing but rather a more sustainable way to give pre-loved items
        a new home, we are dedicated to encourage this change. Our commitment to
        a better future is reflected in our environmentally friendly approach,
        utilising a bag system to modernise the process instead of shipping
        items individually. With this vision in mind, we created this
        application to share our passion for fashion with you and inspire a more
        sustainable way of living. ”
